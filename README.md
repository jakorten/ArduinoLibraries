# ArduinoLibraries

This repo contains useful Arduino libraries for student and/or research projects.
| Code            | Description                                                                                                |   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| [LEDTest](https://github.com/jakorten/SoftRoboticsDevBoard/tree/main/LEDTest)         | Sketch to test the normal LEDs of the DevBoard.                                                            |   |
| [Dual NeoPixel Test](https://github.com/jakorten/SoftRoboticsDevBoard/tree/main/NeoPixelTest) | Simple NeoPixel test for the two Neopixels. |   |
| [ActuatorTest](https://github.com/jakorten/SoftRoboticsDevBoard/tree/main/ActuatorTest)    | Sketch to test the four Actuators of the DevBoard.                                                         |   |
| [WireScanner](https://github.com/jakorten/SoftRoboticsDevBoard/tree/main/WireScanner)     | Sketch that allows to scan all i2c devices on different SERCOM wires of the DevBoard.                                                |   |
| [FRAM_MB85RC_I2C](https://github.com/jakorten/ArduinoLibraries/tree/main/FRAM_MB85RC_I2C) | Is a modified library based on the one from [@sosandroid](https://github.com/sosandroid/FRAM_MB85RC_I2C) that supports SERCOM for Arduino SAMD controllers. |   |

Disclaimer: the sketches and/or libraries might not have been written by myself (but of course I credit the original authors). Coding standards might not be up to the standard we teach and want you to follow. We will try to refactor these libraries as much as possible but often as we need them for rapid prototyping only that might not have been feasible.
