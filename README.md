# ArduinoLibraries

This repo contains useful Arduino libraries for student and/or research projects.

- []() LED tester sketch.
- []() Actuator tester sketch.
- [WireScanner](https://github.com/jakorten/SoftRoboticsDevBoard/tree/main/WireScanner) is a helper sketch that allows to scan all i2c devices of the Development Board.
- [FRAM_MB85RC_I2C](https://github.com/jakorten/ArduinoLibraries/tree/main/FRAM_MB85RC_I2C) is a modified library based on the one from [@sosandroid](https://github.com/sosandroid/FRAM_MB85RC_I2C) that supports SERCOM (Arduino SAMD controllers).

Disclaimer: the libraries might not have been written by myself (but of course I credit the original authors). Coding standards might not be up to the standard we teach and want you to follow. We will try to refactor these libraries as much as possible but often as we need them for rapid prototyping only that might not have been feasible.
